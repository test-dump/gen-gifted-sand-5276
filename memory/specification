Creating a simple "Hello World" console app in C# is straightforward. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. First, start Visual Studio.

2. Click on `File` > `New` > `Project...` or `New Project` (depending on your Visual Studio version).

3. Select `Console Application` (as the project type) under C#.

4. Name your project (for example "HelloWorld") and choose a suitable location for the project on your computer. Then, Click on `OK`.

5. Once you click `OK`, Visual Studio will create a new C# console application project for you. In the `Program.cs` file, you will see some existing code. This is the main entry point for the application.

6. Now, replace the automatically generated code inside the `Main` function with the following lines of C# code that will output "Hello, World!" into the console:

   ```C#
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    Console.ReadKey();
   ```

So, your full code in `Program.cs` should look like this:

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

7. Now, run your program by clicking on `Start` or `Start Debugging` or simply press `F5`.

8. A console window will appear displaying the message "Hello, World!", and it will stay open until you press any key, because of the `Console.ReadKey();` statement. After pressing any key, the console window will close.

That's it! You have just created and run your first C# console application.
